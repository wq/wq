# Survey123 vs. KoBoToolbox vs. wq

The [wq framework] leverages the [XLSForm standard][xlsform] for survey definitions.  This makes it similar to ESRI's [Survey123] and [KoBoToolbox]'s KoboCollect, though with some key differences.  Which solution is right for you will depend on your project goals, budget, and technical expertise.

### Survey Definition
&nbsp; | **Survey123** | **KoBoToolbox** | **wq Framework**
--|--|--|--
*Database Schema* | **Per survey** | Combined generic table | **Per survey**
*Foreign Keys* | Within survey (nested) | No | **Within and between surveys**
*Offline Usage* | **Surveys + basemaps** | Surveys only | Surveys only¹
*XLSForm Formulas* | **Yes** | **Yes** | No²

* ¹ *A custom ServiceWorker can be used to implement offline map support in wq.*
* ² *Similar functionality can be implemented in wq via [custom input components][custom-input].*

### Data Management
&nbsp; | **Survey123** | **KoBoToolbox** | **wq Framework**
--|--|--|--
*Interactive Analysis Tools* | **Yes** | **Yes** | No³
*Interactive Map Viewers* | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes**
*Export to Excel* | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** (via [plugin][django-rest-pandas])
*Import from Excel* | **Yes** (via feature layer) | No | **Yes** (via [plugin][django-data-wizard])

* ³ *The [Django REST Pandas][django-rest-pandas] backend can be used to implement a custom frontend dashboard.*

## Summary

**Survey123** may make the most sense if your users already have an ArcGIS license and/or want to easily generate custom map viewers.  **KoBoToolbox** might be the best option if you have many small surveys and/or your data collection goals are still being refined.  The **wq framework** may be your best choice if you have a relatively stable data model, high customization requirements, and/or need to integrate with an existing database.

Fortunately, all three use the same XLSForm standard, so once you have a survey definition you can easily use it to switch between platforms.
