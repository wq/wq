# wq.start 1.0 beta

**wq.start 1.0.0b1** is the beta release for the upcoming 1.0 version of [wq.start](../overview/setup.md).  This release includes the latest version of the [wq-django-template](../wq.create/index.md), which is now referenced as a submodule.

Previous releases of `wq.start` are listed in the [wq-django-template releases page](https://wq.io/releases/?repo=wq-django-template).  For historical reasons, this repository was extracted out of that one rather than vice-versa.
