# wq.app 1.2.0

**wq.app 1.2.0** is the first stable release of the wq.app 1.2 series.  The biggest improvement is the integration of the Redux ecosystem for the outbox and model store ([#105](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/105)).  This achieves the second goal in the [2019 roadmap for wq.app](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/111).

> wq.app 1.3 will bring full integration with React and Material UI - see [#115](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/115) for a preview.

In addition to the Redux integration, a number of nonessential and deprecated AMD modules have been removed from wq.app 1.2.

##  Other changes since wq.app 1.1.2

* [Changes in Alpha](./wq.app-1.2.0a1.md)

    * [@wq/app]
        * The first page is automatically re-rendered on startup and after auth changes, so jQuery events and other workarounds are no longer needed ([#79](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/79)). 
        * `app.go()` has been removed in favor of `app.nav()`
        * `app.sync(true)` has been renamed to `app.retryAll()`.  In general, sync is managed by [@wq/outbox] and Redux Offline (see below).

    * [@wq/store] is now a wrapper around [Redux] and [Redux Persist].
        * New `dispatch()`, `getState()`, and `subscribe()` methods correspond to Redux equivalents.
        * Enables [Redux Logger] when `config.debug` is true
        * @wq/app plugins that define `name`, `reducer()` and `actions:{}` will get their own state in the store.
        * `jsonp` and `parseData` options are replaced with the [`ajax()` plugin hook][@wq/store]
        * `ds.storageUsage()` has been removed.

    * [@wq/router] is now a wrapper around [Redux-First Router].
        * Routes are defined as Redux action types that map to the template name.
        * Thunks can be defined as pathless non-rendered routes (as per [Redux-First Router]).  @wq/app plugins that define `thunks: {}` will be auto-registered.
        * `router.register()` has completely changed.  The callback is now optional and only needs to supply a context for use with `router.go()`.  `router.go()` no longer can/should be invoked indirectly.
        * `router.addRoute()` is deprecated in favor of `run()` plugin hooks.
        * Route info is now provided only through the template context (and not as `router.info`).

    * [@wq/model] is now a wrapper around [Redux-ORM].
        * A `name` is now required for all model instances.  (@wq/app provides this automatically)
        * The Redux-ORM queryset is available via `[model].objects.all()`.
        * `[model].filter()` now wraps `objects.filter()`, which supports predicate functions and better indexing.  Note that `objects.filter()` uses strict equality when comparing object attributes.
        * `find()`, `update()`, `fetchUpdate()` and `remove()` no longer support specifying an id column.   Instead, define `idCol` when configuring/initializing the model.
        * @wq/model now supports (de)normalization for nested models returned from server APIs ([#114](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/114))

    * [@wq/outbox] is now a wrapper around [Redux Offline].
        * Fix various offline state and syncing issues (e.g. [#33](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/33), [#94](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/94)[/#95](https://github.com///issues/95), and [#102](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/102)).
        * Several new methods to control syncing: `waitForItem()`, `waitForAll()`, `retryItem()`, `retryAll()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, and `empty()`.  Use these instead of `sendItem()`, `sendAll()`, and the `noSend` option for `save()`, all of which have been removed.
        * Batch sync support ([#110](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/110)) via [Django Batch Requests]
        * `applyState` configuration option for form submissions ([#85](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/85), [#86](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/86)):
            * `"ON_SUCCESS"` (default): update local model after sync.
            * `"IMMEDIATE"`: optimistically update local model before sync
            * `"LOCAL_ONLY"`: update local model without syncing
        * `outbox.model.load()` is removed in favor of `outbox.loadItems()`
        * `parseBatchResult()`, `applyResult()` and `updateModels()` are no longer available.

    * Other Changes
        * [@wq/map]: copy layer config in case it is modified by function ([`440dc9b`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/440dc9b))
        * [@wq/map]: don't update sticky bounds when map is off-screen ([`5952fe6`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/5952fe6))
        * `removeattachment` action in [@wq/app:patterns][@wq/app] plugin ([`d5372ff`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/d5372ff))
        * Sourcemaps for wq/* AMD modules ([`43222ff`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/43222ff))
        * Remove compatibility versions of wq/autocomplete.js, wq/console.js, wq/json.js, and wq/progress.js, which were deprecated in [wq.app 1.1.2](./wq.app-1.1.2.md).
