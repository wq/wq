# wq.core 1.2 beta

**wq.core 1.2.0b1** is the beta of the upcoming 1.2 version of wq.core.  The functionality is the same, with a few cosmetic improvements:

 * use setuptools_scm & markdown readme (1a4cfab)
 * use safe_load() to avoid YAML warning (ce2dca7)
 * don't check if wq.io is installed - it was renamed to [IterTable](https://django-data-wizard.wq.io/itertable/) (509c90f)
