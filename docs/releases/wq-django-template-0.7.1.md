# wq.start 0.7.1

- Enable [jQuery Mobile SCSS themes](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/tree/v1.3.0/packages/jquery-mobile/scss/jquery-mobile.scss) by default, taking advantage of wq.app's new [wq/swatches.scss](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/blob/v1.3.0/packages/jquery-mobile/scss/swatches.scss).
- More careful deletion of existing `htdocs/` in case it's a symlink.
