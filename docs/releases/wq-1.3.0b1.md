# wq 1.3 beta

**wq 1.3 beta** brings a number of improvements to the [@wq/material](../@wq/material.md) renderer introduced in [wq.app 1.3 alpha](./wq.app-1.3.0a1.md).  While wq 1.3 is largely ready for production use, this is marked as a beta release to allow any remaining bugs to be identified.  Be sure specify the exact version when installing:

```
python3 -m pip install wq==1.3.0b1
```

See the submodule release notes for additional details:
- [wq.app 1.3 beta](./wq.app-1.3.0b1.md)
- [wq.build 1.3 beta](./wq.build-1.3.0b1.md) (formerly **wq.core**)
- [wq.create 1.3 beta](./wq.create-1.3.0b1.md) (formerly **wq.start**)
- [wq.db 1.3 beta](./wq.db-1.3.0b1.md)

In addition to the code changes, the [documentation site](../index.md) has been completely overhauled, with interactive [component demos](../inputs/index.md) and [guides](../guides/index.md), as well as new logos for wq and all submodules.
