# wq.db 0.8.5

**wq.db 0.8.5** brings a couple of minor bug fixes:
- don't override manually defined serializer labels ([`c5bbd1f`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/c5bbd1f34ad1f2758b8a28df3b820f5149835101))
- don't assume relate model is installed ([`8f7ff7e`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/8f7ff7ed027797f05b1852b81762b53169871854), see https://github.com/powered-by-wq/species.wq.io/issues/3)
- ignore empty attachments (useful when saving new patterns-based models) ([`e517b7d`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/e517b7dbeb5425316bb00b58d854472731bac32d))
