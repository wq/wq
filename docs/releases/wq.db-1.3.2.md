# wq.db 1.3.2

**wq.db 1.3.2** brings Django 4.1 compatibility to the wq.db 1.3 branch.  Thanks to [@tomaszn](https://github.com/tomaszn) for contributing the necessary changes ([#85](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/issues/85)).

> Note that wq.db 1.3's EAV support does not work with Django 4.1 - if you need this, consider updating to wq 2.0 which handles all EAV logic on the client.
