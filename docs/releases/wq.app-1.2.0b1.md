# wq.app 1.2 beta

**wq.app 1.2.0b1** is the beta version of the upcoming wq.app 1.2 release.  In addition to the [major changes introduced in **wq.app 1.2 alpha**](./wq.app-1.2.0a1.md), wq.app 1.2 beta includes the following updates:

## New Features

Thanks to [@tomaszn](https://github.com/tomaszn) for feedback on the design of many of these features.

 * If the current URL contains the temporary ID of an unsynced record (e.g. `"outbox-123"`), automatically navigate to the new URL once synced ([#98](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/98), [#99](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/99))
 * New `filter_fields` and `filter_ignore` configuration options for [@wq/model](../@wq/model.md).  If a URL parameter is not found in`form`, `functions`, or `filter_fields`, it will be ignored when filtering list views ([#88](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/88)).
 * Simplified `onsync(item)` plugin hook, called after each outbox item is synced to the server ([#96](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/96))
 * Better management of URL params during pagination ([`778631c`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/778631c), [`c2b5ab0`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/c2b5ab0))


## Removed Features

To clean up the API and prepare for a future migration away from jQuery Mobile ([#111](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/111)), this release removes several older hooks and events, as noted in the updated [@wq/app documentation](../@wq/app.md) and below.

name | type | suggested migration path
-----|------|-------------------------
`onsave(item, result)` | Plugin Hook | Use an `onsync()` hook instead.  The server result will be available as `item.result`.
`saveerror(item, reason, $form)` | Config Hook | Use an `onsync()` hook instead.  The error will be available as `item.error`.
`showOutboxErrors()` | Config Hook | Use an `onsync()` and/or `run()` plugin hook instead.
`postsave()` | Config Hook | Use a `postsaveurl()` plugin hook instead.
`presync()` / `postsync()` | Config Hook | Use the template context as needed for UI customizations.  Pages displaying outbox contents are automatically re-rendered after each sync.
`"login"`, `"logout"` | jQuery events | Use the template context as needed for UI customizations.  As of wq.app 1.2, all pages (including server-rendered pages) are automatically re-rendered on the client if the login state changes.
`config.transitions.save` | jQuery Mobile transition | This was a wq.app-specific configurable transition and has no effect in 1.2.  The `default` and `dialog` transitions remain configurable, but it is recommended to leave them as `"none"`.

In addition to the above, note that the `ui` option passed to jQuery Mobile navigation events is no longer used, as [Redux First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router) now handles all navigation.  Among other things, this means that setting `data-transition` or `data-direction` on an `<a href>` no longer has any effect.

## Bug Fixes
 * Confirm rare sync timing issue no longer exists in @wq/outbox ([#102](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/issues/102))
 * Fix issues with refresh logic ([`c738019`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/c738019)) and sync navigation logic ([`b42d152`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/b42d152))
 * Bind `this` to plugin for `reducer()` and `render()` plugin hooks ([`e94ebd6`](https://github.com/wq/wq.app/commit/e94ebd6))
