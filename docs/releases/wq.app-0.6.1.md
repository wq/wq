# wq.app 0.6.1

This release provides a couple of incremental improvements to wq.app 0.6.0.

### API improvements
- **[wq/progress.js](https://django-data-wizard.wq.io/@wq/progress)**:  onProgress event; fix intermediate state
- **[wq/app.js](../@wq/app.md)**: don't loadFromServer if list is known to be empty
- **[wq/store.js](../@wq/store.md)**: use prefix to avoid reseting other stores
