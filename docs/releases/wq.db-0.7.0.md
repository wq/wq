# wq.db 0.7.0

**wq.db 0.7.0** introduces Python 3 and Django 1.7 support, as well as a number of minor bug fixes and API cleanup.

## API Improvements
- Support for Python 3 (#2).  Python 2.7 is still supported (for now), but we strongly recommend using Python 3 for new projects.
- Support for Django 1.7, including new [swapper](https://github.com/wq/django-swappable-models)-enabled Django 1.7 migrations (#28)
- Ability to use [chart](https://django-rest-pandas.wq.io/serializers/) for arbitrary time series models in addition to [vera](#29).
- Continued to expand test suite (#13), wq.app compatibility (#25), and documentation (wq/wq#7)
- Various minor bug fixes

## New Features
- New `mark` pattern to support attaching one or more markdown snippets to models (#30)
- `dump_config` command for generating a static [wq config](../config.md) object to speed up application load (ed14f600694016ab66f7d4b81d50327b17ef3da9).  Requires Django 1.7.
- `set_extra_config()` method to define arbitrary wq config properties (570b9ad1d5bef4b9f28c9be1d954b5a0734823d7)

## Removed Features
- A number of contrib modules have been extracted into separate PyPI packages (#29).  This includes [vera](https://github.com/powered-by-wq/vera), [dbio](https://django-data-wizard.wq.io/), and the [media thumbnailer](https://github.com/wq/django-media-thumbnailer) that was previously part of [files](../wq.db/patterns.md).  If your code depends on any of these modules, you will need to install them separately and update your import statements (e.g. `from wq.db.contrib.vera import models` -> `from vera import models`.
- Removed support for auto-discovering `views.py` and `serializers.py`.  All of your auto-discoverable router configurations should be defined in `rest.py` (#12)
