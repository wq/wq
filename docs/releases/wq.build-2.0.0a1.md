# wq.build 2.0 alpha

**wq.build 2.0.0a1** is the alpha of the upcoming 2.0 version of wq.build.  The functionality is mostly the same as wq.build 1.3, with a few changes (all by [@sheppard](https://github.com/sheppard)).

 * Removed the deprecated `wq versions` command ([`437b86d`](https://github.com/wq/wq.build/commit/437b86d))
 * In default serviceWorker template, ignoreVary when loading index.html ([`3e3f666`](https://github.com/wq/wq.build/commit/3e3f666))
 * Switch to pyproject.toml, update layout, and test latest Python version.  ([`32068b3`](https://github.com/wq/wq.build/commit/32068b3), [`01cb337`](https://github.com/wq/wq.build/commit/01cb337))
