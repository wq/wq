# wq.db 1.1.4

**wq.db 1.1.4** brings a couple of minor changes to restore backwards compatibility with older versions of 1.1.

 * Restrict Django REST Framework to version 3.9 (see [#77](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/issues/77)).  Support for DRF 3.10 will be added in wq.db 1.2.
 * Temporarily revert [#62](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/issues/62) and [#69](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/issues/69).  These will be restored in wq.db 1.2.

Thanks [@tomaszn](https://github.com/tomaszn) and [@MartinPontius](https://github.com/MartinPontius) for bringing attention to these issues.
