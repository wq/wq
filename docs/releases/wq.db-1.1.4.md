# wq.db 1.1.4

**wq.db 1.1.4** brings a couple of minor changes to restore backwards compatibility with older versions of 1.1.

 * Restrict Django REST Framework to version 3.9 (see #77).  Support for DRF 3.10 will be added in wq.db 1.2.
 * Temporarily revert #62 and #69.  These will be restored in wq.db 1.2.

Thanks @tomaszn and @MartinPontius for bringing attention to these issues.
