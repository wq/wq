# wq.db 0.8.2

This release of **wq.db** brings some enhancements to the "attachment" modules and a few minor bug fixes.

## Attachment Enhancements
- [locate](../wq.db/patterns.md)'s `Location` instances for located models can be loaded directly into the map for editing via a special `edit.geojson` URL.  This works well with the updated [wq/map.js](../@wq/map.md) in [wq.app 0.8.1](./wq.app-0.8.1.md).  Note that as part of this enhancement, the `Location` model is no longer registered with the API by default (meaning `Location` instances will not be stored offline by default).
- [files](../wq.db/patterns.md)' `File` instances can be uploaded as "attachments" making files a bit more like the [patterns](../wq.db/patterns.md) modules ([`bc14412`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/bc14412)).  There is a little bit of customization necessary to get this to work - see the [Species Tracker source](https://github.com/powered-by-wq/species.wq.io/blob/v0.2.0/db/reports/serializers.py#L1-L15) for an example.
- `create_attachment()` and `update_attachment()` hooks to facilitate customized [patterns](../wq.db/patterns.md) model workflows ([`0edf702`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/0edf702))

## Bug Fixes
- Fix [wq configuration object](../config.md) not listing parent models correctly (due to `get_all_related_objects()` change in Django 1.8 ([`20cd687`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/20cd687)))
- Ensure server-side [postsave](../wq.db/views.md) is triggered on `update()` ([`450ee3a`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/450ee3a))
- Fix for template vars in Python 2 + Django 1.8 ([`30e11d9`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/30e11d9))
- update `router_info` template variable name ([`b4b5daa`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/b4b5daa)) and include parent page identifier in list-by-parent-item context ([`ac92abd`](https://github.com/wq/wq.db/commit/ac92abd))
