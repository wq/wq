# wq 0.8.0

wq 0.8.0 is perhaps the most ambitious release of wq to date.  A number of APIs in [wq.app](https://wq.io/wq.app) and [wq.db](https://wq.io/wq.db) have been significantly improved - though at the cost of backwards compatibility.  See the submodule release notes for more information.
- [wq.app 0.8.0](./wq.app-0.8.0.md)
- [wq.core 0.8.0](./wq.core-0.8.0.md) (new in wq 0.8.0)
- [wq.db 0.8.1](./wq.db-0.8.1.md) (see also the release notes for [wq.db 0.8.0](./wq.db-0.8.0.md))
- [wq.io 0.8.0](./itertable-0.8.0.md)
- [wq.start 0.8.1](./wq.start-0.8.1.md)

As discussed in the release notes for [wq.db 0.8.0](./wq.db-0.8.0.md), this is expected to be the last major change to wq before version 1.0.  The jump from wq 0.8 to wq 1.0 is expected to be relatively minor, consisting primarily of bug fixes and improvements to the Patterns API (wq/wq.db#35, wq/wq.app#38).
