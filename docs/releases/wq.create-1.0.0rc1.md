# wq.start 1.0.0 RC1

**wq.start 1.0.0 RC1** brings the [wq django template 1.0.0 RC1] and a number of other improvements.

### `wq start`

The `wq start` command now requires a domain name (via the `-d` flag).  This is used to generate the default Apache configuration, and is also reversed to create an application identifier for PhoneGap Build.  (The identifier can be overridden with the `-i` flag).  `wq start` now requires Django 1.10 or newer, though once an application is generated with `wq start` it can still be used with Django 1.8. ([wq/wq-django-template#4](https://github.com/wq/wq-django-template/issues/4), [`a40ee66`](https://github.com/wq/wq.create/commit/a40ee66))

### `wq addform`

`wq addform` now attempts to automatically add the generated app to `INSTALLED_APPS`, then run and apply the requisite migrations.  It is even possible to change the XLSForm, and then run `wq addform` again to update and migrate an existing model.  Confirmation will be requested before each dangerous action (unless `-f` is specified). ([#3](https://github.com/wq/wq.create/issues/3), [`e64ebf5`](https://github.com/wq/wq.create/commit/e64ebf5), [`29d8b08`](https://github.com/wq/wq.create/commit/29d8b08))

### Various Improvements
 * Ensure the HTML output of `wq maketemplates` and `wq addform` is  more or less the same ([`7a73670`](https://github.com/wq/wq.create/commit/7a73670); see the release notes for [wq.db 1.0.0 RC1])
 * Avoid extra `.git` in PyPI package ([#4](https://github.com/wq/wq.create/issues/4))
 * List wq start version in generated settings.py
