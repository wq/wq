**@wq/app** provides a configuration-driven JavaScript application controller to facilitate the creation of complete mobile web apps for viewing and submitting field data.   @wq/app is primarily intended for use as a client for [wq.db.rest], but can be customized for use with any REST service.

## Overview

@wq/app is the highest-level wq.app module, and brings together a number of lower-level modules and wq conventions into an integrated API.  The specific concepts leveraged by @wq/app include:

 * A specific [URL structure] that is observed by both the application itself and its REST API.
 * A client-side URL router ([@wq/router]) and page renderer ([@wq/react] + [@wq/material])
 * A model-driven, `localForage`-backed cache of REST API responses ([@wq/model]), with an offline-capable outbox to sync form submissions back to the server ([@wq/outbox]).
 * A [wq configuration object][config] generated by the URL router on the server, that describes the available routes and underlying models.
 * An optional [authentication][auth] endpoint provided by the REST API, including CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site attacks.
 * A simple [plugin API][plugins] to facilitate adding optional functionality such as interactive [maps][@wq/map] or even a fully custom data model (via plugin hooks).

## Installation

@wq/app is available via a PyPI package ([wq.app](http://pypi.org/project/wq.app)) as well as an npm package ([@wq/app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wq/app)).  If you are not sure which one to use, use the PyPI package to get started.  It is possible to later convert a PyPI wq.app project into a npm @wq/app project (with a few changes).

#### wq.app for PyPI

```bash
python3 -m venv venv      # create virtual env (if needed)
. venv/bin/activate       # activate virtual env
python3 -m pip install wq # install wq framework (wq.app, wq.build, wq.create, wq.db)
# pip install wq.app      # install wq.app only
```

#### @wq/app for npm

```bash
npm install @wq/app
```

### Project Layout

Whether using wq.app for Python or @wq/app for npm, we highly recommend using [wq.create] to initialize your project.  In particular, wq.create will automatically configure your JavaScript build settings and link the proper imports for @wq/app.  If you are not using wq.create, you can create a similar layout using the examples below.

#### wq.app for PyPI

```javascript
// "wq create --without-npm" creates a layout similar to this:

// static/app/js/myapp.js
import wq from './wq.js';
import config from './data/config.js';

wq.init(config).then(() => {
    wq.prefetchAll();
});

// index.html
// <script type="module" src="/static/app/js/myapp.js"></script>
```

#### @wq/app for npm

```javascript
// "wq create --with-npm" is similar to create-react-app, but
// replaces the contents of src/index.js with something like this:

import app from '@wq/app';
import config from './config';

app.init(config).then(() => {
    app.prefetchAll();
});

// public/index.html
// <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/css/myapp.css" />
```

## API

`@wq/app` is typically imported as `app`, or as `wq` when imported from the [wq.js bundle][wq].  Any local variable name can be used.  The app module provides the following methods and properties.

### Configuration

#### `app.init(config)`

The main required usage of @wq/app is to initialize by passing a [wq Configuration object][config] to `app.init()`.  The function returns a [Promise] that will be resolved when the initialization is complete.  After the app is configured,`app.prefetchAll()` can be used to preload and cache data from all registered models (i.e. all entries in the `pages` configuration that have `list` set to `true`).

```javascript
app.init(config).then(() => {
    app.prefetchAll();  // Optional
});
```

The available [configuration options][config] are shown below with their default values.

```javascript
{
    // @wq/app options
    'debug': false,
    'autoStart': true, // If false, then call app.start() after init
    'backgroundSync': true,
    'loadMissingAsHtml': true, // alternatively, loadMissingAsJson: false
    
    'pages': { /* ... */ }, // from wq config
 
    // Configuration for core modules
    'router': { /* ... */ },
    'store': { /* ... */ },
    'outbox': { /* ... */ },
    
    // Configuration for registered plugins
    'map': { /* ... */ }
}
```

The configuration sections for the other core modules are passed on to the `init()` function for each module.  In a few instances, @wq/app overrides the default settings for the respective modules.  See the documentation for [wq Configuration object][config], [@wq/router], [@wq/store], [@wq/outbox], and [@wq/model] for more information about the available configuration options for each module.  Similarly, any registered plugins can be configured via sections with the same name as the respective plugins.

##### Scalar Options

The `debug` option enables console logging in @wq/app and the other core modules.  If specified as a number, `debug` will set the verbosity level in @wq/store.

The `autoStart` option tells `app.init()` to immediately trigger `app.start()` on startup.  The default is true, but you can set to false if you need to register additional custom routes before initializing React and Redux.

The boolean `backgroundSync` flag controls the default behavior for @wq/outbox form submissions.  When `true` (the default), form submissions are synced in the background while the user is navigated to the next screen.  When `false`, forms remain on screen until the server responds.  `backgroundSync` can also be enabled or disabled on a per-form basis by setting the `backgroundSync` prop.  For example, the [Login view][Login] sets `backgroundSync` to false since it makes more sense to wait for a successful login before continuing.

The `loadMissingAsHtml` and  `loadMissingAsJson` options tell @wq/app what to do if the user navigates to a model instance that is not stored locally.  There are three possible outcomes in this case:
  * If the associated model page is configured with `partial: false`, @wq/app will assume the entire model collection is stored locally, assume the page does not exist, and call the `router.notFound()` 404 page.
  * If the associated model page is configured with `partial: true`, and `loadMissingAsHtml` is set, @wq/app will attempt to load the page from the server and assume the server is capable of rendering content as HTML.
  * If the associated model page is configured with `partial: true`, and `loadMissingAsJson` is set, @wq/app will attempt to load the missing data from the server as JSON and render it locally.

##### `pages`: URL routes

The `pages` configuration section is equivalent to the option with the same name in the [wq configuration object][config].  The `pages` configuration is typically generated by the REST service and describes the URL routes in the application.  The full list of page options is described in the documentation for the [wq configuration object][config].

> **Note**: If you need to customize an option in the server generated `pages`, you should specify it when calling [router.register_model()][router] in [wq.db.rest] rather than overriding the `pages` section in your `config.js`.  This ensures that the client and the server are on the same "page".

As noted above, [@wq/model] instances for all model-backed pages (those with `list: true`) will be added to `app.models` for convenience.

#### Creating a Configuration Module

The configuration object is typically defined as a module `config.js` that depends on the [server-created wq config][config], then adds the additional attributes needed to initialize @wq/app.

```javascript
import config from './data/config.js';

// config.pages already exists in server-generated wq config

export default {
    material: {
        theme: {
            primary: '#99999',
            secondary: '#333333',
        }
    },
    ...config
}
```

### Methods

#### `app.use(plugin)`

Register a plugin to customize @wq/app functionality.  See [Plugins][plugins].

#### `app.nav(path)`

Trigger a route change to the specified path, which should not include the application base URL.

```javascript
app.nav('items/1');
```

#### `app.user`

If the application supports authentication and the user is logged in, `app.user` will be set with information about the current user provided by the server.  This information will also be available in the [render context][useRenderContext] and [auth plugin state][usePluginState].

#### `app.config`, `app.wq_config`
A copy of the @wq/app configuration object (see above) and the [wq configuration object][config], respectively.  Initially `app.config.pages` and `app.wq_config.pages` are the same, but after logging in, `app.wq_config` is overwritten with an updated wq configuration object with permissions information specific to the logged-in user.

#### `app.models`

After initialization, `app.models` will contain a [@wq/model] instances for each registered model (i.e. each item in the `pages` configuration with `list: true`).

```javascript
app.models.item.filter({'type_id': 2}).then(function(type2items) {
    type2items.forEach(function(item) {
        console.log(item.id + ' - ' + item.label);
    });
});
```
